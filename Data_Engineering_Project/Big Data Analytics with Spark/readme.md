# Search Term Analysis and Sales Forecasting with Apache Spark

## Overview
We analyze e-commerce search term data and forecast future sales using **Apache Spark** within **Jupyter Notebook**. The data originates from web server logs, and we leverage Spark's distributed computing capabilities to perform efficient data processing. This project aims to provide insights into search behavior and predict future sales trends using machine learning models.

## Objectives
- **Analyze e-commerce search term data** to uncover patterns and trends.
- **Forecast future sales** using a pre-trained sales prediction model.
- Efficiently handle large datasets using **Apache Spark** and **PySpark** for distributed processing.
- Implement data transformation and querying techniques within **Jupyter Notebook**.

## Steps and Tasks

### 1. Load and Explore Data
- **Data Source**: Web server log file in CSV format.
- Load the data into a **Spark DataFrame** for analysis.
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to understand key trends in search terms, such as identifying popular search terms, frequency, and patterns over time.

### 2. Query and Analyze Data
- Use **Spark SQL** to run queries against the search term data.
- Generate insights on search behavior, including:
  - Most frequent search terms.
  - Search trends based on time or specific user behaviors.

### 3. Sales Forecasting
- Load a **pre-trained sales forecasting model**.
- Apply the model to predict next year's sales based on historical data.
- Analyze and visualize the prediction results to provide business insights.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- **Apache Spark**: Distributed computing framework used for processing large datasets.
- **PySpark**: Python API for Spark used to handle data transformation and querying.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for running Spark code and performing machine learning tasks.
- **Spark SQL**: SQL-based querying engine used to query structured data.
- **Pre-trained Sales Forecasting Model**: Machine learning model used to predict future sales based on historical data.

## Key Files
- **`Spark_MLOps.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook containing all the steps for loading, processing, and analyzing the search term data, as well as the sales forecasting model.

## Results
- Successfully identified patterns and trends in e-commerce search terms, helping to understand user behavior better.
- Applied a machine learning model to predict future sales, providing insights for business planning and decision-making.
- Efficiently processed large datasets using Apache Spark, ensuring scalability and performance.

## Conclusion
This project showcases the application of Apache Spark in analyzing e-commerce data and making data-driven business predictions. Through Spark SQL queries and machine learning, the project provides valuable insights into user search behavior and forecasts sales to support strategic decisions.
